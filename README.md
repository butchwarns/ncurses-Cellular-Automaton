# ncurses_Cellular_Automaton
An elementary cellular automaton with a text-based user interface for your terminal.  

## Motivation
This project is my attempt at making rule 30, a cellular automaton introduced by Stephen Wolfram in 1983, easily explorable for the interested.

When I first read about cellular automata, I was immediately captivated by the intricate patterns that could be generated by applying one simple rule over and over again. Repeating patterns, fractal shapes and chaos follow from just eight bits, that form the rule. 

The **ncurses-Cellular-Automaton** makes it easy to quickly try out all of the 256 rules on different starting conditions and get a feel for how an elementary CA works.

I suggest reading Wolfram's (free) book [A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/) for an introduction to the mechanics behind rule 30 and other cellular automata.

**TODO** *Include logo/demo screenshot etc.*

## Tech/framework used
The ncurses library, wrapped in C++, is used to render all graphics on the terminal.

## Features
- Command line program with text-based UI
- Real-time implementation
- Continuous animation or stepped
- Randomizable rule
- Randomizable initial conditions
- Runs on most machines
- Code documentation

Feel free to fork and modify!

## Installation
The project is built using CMake and is therefore easily compiled on most operating systems.
It is preconfigured for MacOS or other UNIX-based environments. Just run `build.sh` to invoke `make`.

`configure.sh` is used in case the `CMakeLists.txt` is updated.  
`rule.sh` just runs the executable in the build folder.

**MacOS:**
  1. `git clone` the repository
  2. Run `build.sh` to compile the program

**Windows:**
  - On Windows the configuration and build scripts need to be updated to create a VSCode project or similar.
  - **TODO** *add installation isntructions for Windows users.*
 
 
**Linux:**
  - You know what to do :)
